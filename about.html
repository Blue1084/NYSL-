          General Info
        </h2>
        <p>
        The Northside Youth Soccer League was established in 1996 to provide athletes residing in Chicago's northside
        neighborhood an environment to learn and play soccer. To be a member of NYSL, you must be between the ages of
        4-12 and reside in a Chicago northside neighborhood. NYSL is run by a small, full-time staff, and relies on the
        generous volunteer time of parents and former league members.
